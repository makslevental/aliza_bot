<br>
<p> </p> When New Haven was founded by Puritans in 1638, the green was sized in accordance with the Book of Exodus so that it would be able to fit the 144,000 Christians prophesied to be saved&mdash;standing shoulder to shoulder&mdash;when the rapture came.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why it is the largest in New England.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was used as a cemetery until 1821 and it is estimated that there are between 4,000-5,0000 bodies buried underneath.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower part of the green holds a flagpole with a granite World War I memorial at its base designed by New Haven-based architect Douglas Orr in 1928 with a fountain added in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of these ways, the green serves as a standing ground and resting place for those who are counted and remembered.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also serves as a reminder of those who aren&rsquo;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one way we might feel ourselves to be a fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;We might imagine what it would be like to the 144,001<sup>st</sup> Christian.&nbsp;&nbsp;We might envision, if we do not already know, what it is like to slip through the cracks of those official counts that promise to preserve, enable, or protect us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We might think of all those lives and deaths not marked by gravestones, flagpoles, or statues&mdash;deaths often not narrativized as deaths, but merely as the byproduct of the nation&rsquo;s formation and functioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;The &ldquo;fiction,&rdquo; in this case, would be our absence, an erasure that would suggest we never were.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> But I am interested in a different kind of historical fiction, one that manifests not as invisibility, but as hypervisibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are counted by history become monuments to us the living, beacons for a certain kind of belief, idea, or narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our subsequent invocations of these figures inevitably introduce a drift, until eventually, citations of citations, they come to resemble the person who invokes them in the present more than the person they actually were.&nbsp;&nbsp;They might even come to stand for things that were anathema to their original intents.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slow peeling of the person from their representation, and it is the latter that lives on in a discursive afterlife.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, time presents a strange double-bind: we will either be produced as fictions to a historical record because we never mattered, or we will be produced as fictions because we did.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> Standing on the green, thinking about those who stood there before you and those who lie there underneath you, you might feel a sense of uncanniness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo;&mdash;that specific feeling of unease or discomfort that takes on an eerie or profound dimension&mdash;translates from the German <i>unheimlich</i>, literally, &ldquo;un-homely.&rdquo;  For Freud, the <i>unheimlich</i> disturbs us so because of its relation to the heimlich: it is not simply strangeness or difference itself that unsettles, but a difference in what should be familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course, being Freud, all of this has a relationship to the dynamics of the family, or more specifically the horror of the maternal body.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he writes:
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p><p style="line-height: 20px;padding-right: 10%;padding-left: 10%;font-size: smaller;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This <i>unheimlich</i> place, however, is the entrance to the former <i>Heim</i> [home] of all human beings, to the place where each one of us lived once upon a time and in the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a joking saying that &lsquo;Love is a homesickness&rsquo; and whenever man dreams of a place or a country and says to himself, while he is still dreaming: &lsquo;this place is familiar to me, I have been here before&rsquo; we may interpret the place as being his mother&rsquo;s genitals or her body.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case too, then, the <i>unheimlich</i> is what was once <i>heimisch</i>, familiar; the prefix &lsquo;<i>un</i>&rsquo; [&lsquo;un-&rsquo;] is the token of repression.<sup>1</sup> </span></p>

<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> &ldquo;Home&rdquo; in this account is both spatial and temporal&mdash;the physical womb from which we all were once birthed, a time before we came to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;In different ways, we seek to return to this before place and time through the drives that Freud identifies: the death drive, a drive towards non-being, stasis; and the sex drive, a drive towards perpetual being extended through reproduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both, in inverse ways, obviate the self.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sex and death reach forward to a moment where the subject will cease to be, a reminder of that moment back in time before the subject was.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> Uncanniness thus often has both an element of doubling as well as a metaphysical overtone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the stuff of science fiction, ghost stories, nightmares: the evil twin, the familiar phantasm, the robot that appears almost-but-not-quite real.&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncanny is that slight distance or disconnect between the familiar world we know and the one we experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;We sometimes describe this in the language of &ldquo;haunting.&rdquo;  Stripped of its supernatural miasma, haunting is the pull of an unsettled past on the present: things like unverified events, uncorroborated accounts, the ruptures, elisions, and erasures that that constitute the dark matter of a historical record.&nbsp;&nbsp;Genealogical, epigenetic, haunting is the stuff of inherited trauma, recessive epistasis, scarlet letters&mdash;familial horrors of another kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Old Testament idea, writ in blood, paper, stone, <i>that the sins of the father are carried out upon the sons until the third and fourth generation</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, we might say that there is an uncanniness to any historical figure, to the person doubled in time&mdash;split between who they were and who they have become to us.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> Civic monuments and historical records often insist on a single symbolic function of those who are remembered.&nbsp;&nbsp;The monument itself, as a singular erect architectural object, often has a relationship to what Freud describes as the logic of the phallus&mdash;not simply for the way they look, but for the way they embody a voice of authority, the Law of the Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there has been much discussion of late about who should appear on monuments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through whose life narrative do we tell the story of the nation?  Who &ldquo;belongs&rdquo; in granite, marble, or bronze?  We understand certain figures&mdash;despite whatever violence they have committed, whatever divisions they have stood for, whatever systems of oppression they have perpetuated&mdash;to fit this model of historical memory and American heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have not been extended the same selective remembrance and remain too mired in the complexity of their lives and legacies.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> Take, for example, Norma McCorvey, known to history as the &ldquo;Jane Roe&rdquo; of the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, which effectively legalized abortion in the United States and remains a litmus test in the current political landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot about Norma McCorvey that goes undiscussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a lesbian and grew up working poor and described herself as living on the edge of poverty for most of her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;As she recounts in a 1994 interview, &ldquo;I only ever slept with four or five men, but I got pregnant with three of them.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>  The pregnancy in question in the Roe decision was her third.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite her role in securing the right for other women, she never had an abortion, giving birth before the resolution of her court case.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same 1994 interview, she narrates a poignant and perhaps telling scene between her and her young lawyer Sarah Weddington:
<p> </p>
<br>
<p style="line-height: 20px;padding-right: 10%;padding-left: 10%;font-size: smaller;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ldquo;Sarah sat right across from me at Columbo&rsquo;s pizza parlor, and I didn&rsquo;t know until two years ago that she had had an abortion herself. [...] When I told her then how desperately I needed one, she could have told me where to go for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But she wouldn&rsquo;t because she needed me to be pregnant for her case.&nbsp;&nbsp;I set Sarah Weddington up on a pedestal like a rose petal.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it came my turn, well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah saw these cuts on my wrists, my swollen eyes from crying, the miserable person sitting across from her, and she knew she had a patsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew I wouldn&rsquo;t go outside of the realm of her and Linda [Coffee, the other lawyer involved in the case].&nbsp;&nbsp;I was too scared.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one of the most hideous times of my life.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> McCorvey infamously switched sides on the issue of abortion and became a pro-life/anti-choice activist.&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1995, about 8 months after this interview was published, she met Philip &ldquo;Flip&rdquo; Benham of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue and began on a trajectory that would culminate in 2005 with her petitioning the Supreme Court to overturn the Roe decision with <i>McCorvey v. Hill</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;And while it&rsquo;s possible to read this story with that in mind&mdash;as a parable that provides justification for what would be so hard for many of her former allies to understand&mdash;I find it telling in other ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to sum up the question that is actually at the heart of abortion itself, which is not if life matters, but whose life matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or more concretely: Do we value the lives, voices, and decisions of women?  Do we recognize their bodies as theirs?  Do we believe them and enable them when they tell us what they want?
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> As a historical figure, McCorvey is often positioned as either for or against the legalization of abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is either Roe, or a woman full of regret.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet what both these characterizations miss is the main issue, which is that her story is one of not only bodily but also economic disempowerment.&nbsp;&nbsp;McCorvey herself tells us this in that 1994 anecdote.&nbsp;&nbsp;She sits in front of someone richer than her, more powerful than her, who has more access than her, and asks for something&mdash;begs, cries, pleads.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then that person decides <i>for</i> her that in the greater balance of things, her present suffering is worth what it will enable for others in the long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting in front of Weddington that day, McCorvey was forced to accept what so many women who don&rsquo;t have access to abortion and reproductive choice are forced to accept by the people in power: that your life, your pain, your fear, all matter less than the belief they hold in the potentiality of life not yet here&mdash;life <i>that insofar as they can imagine it resembling their own</i>, matters more.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> McCorvey is a fiction in the ways she has become a sign, a person standing in for an issue overburdened with civic and religious histories.&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was also a fiction in her everyday life, someone who felt she didn&rsquo;t count in a broader social and economic landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the human substrate of both a landmark legal decision&mdash;for which so many women, myself included, are grateful&mdash; and an exclusionary mainstream feminism that took from her more than it gave.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paradoxically, her fictive status as a hypervisible symbol of reproductive rights was enabled by her other fictive status as an invisible queer working class woman.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> By many accounts&mdash;particularly of those who were closest to her&mdash;Norma McCorvey was a fabulist, a user, a liar, an opportunist, and a &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;A bad daughter, bad mother, bad girlfriend, bad feminist, she challenged every narrative we have about womanhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, she was selectively celebrated and punished.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t speak to the veracity of any of these characterizations, for I receive her like everyone else who never knew her, as a historical fiction grown over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been wondering, though:  What would a monument to this woman, who inarguably transformed American life, look like?  Hers, like many of ours, is a story that does not fit the neat singular phallic structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a monument might take a feminine maternal form, one positioned in that same Freudian discourse as vacuous yet teeming, a fecund lack.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might take the form of viral transmission, one that spreads through an intimate web of digital connection.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> The email invitation that has been sent in your name to all the contacts stored in your Gmail account will serve as a memorial to this difficult woman, and to all the difficult women to whom we are indebted.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it memorializes you as a fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;It travels through your email contact list, peeling the &ldquo;you&rdquo; that clicked on the consent buttons from the &ldquo;you&rdquo; that digitally disseminates through inboxes now.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have become the uncanny double of yourself, a ghost, an automaton, a sign that circulates beyond your control creating a temporal dissonance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Barreling forward, your name has become a digital germ, one that interpellates as it incants.
<p> </p>
<br>
<p> </p> To feel yourself a fiction is to feel your relation and non-relation to time, to feel your life as a fleeting moment between two forms of oblivion: the extensity of biological or representational reproduction and the finality of death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time takes us from ourselves and hands us back to a collective as something ephemeral as a memory or solid as stone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Visible or invisible, we have become something other than ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;To feel yourself a fiction is to feel yourself animated beyond your body, to feel yourself fragmented and reproduced over and over again throughout the days, months, and years.
